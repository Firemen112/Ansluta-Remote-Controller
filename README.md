# Ansluta-Remote-Controller
DIY remote controller for the Ikea Ansluta lights (the 2.4Ghz version)

##Intro

The Ansluta (OMLOP) line of Ikea lamps only let u use one remote controller for each light. 
I wanted to use multiple remotes to control one string of lights.

Another caveat of the original remotes is that it can only cycle through the different brightness levels. It cycles though: 0% - 50% - 100% - 50% - 0% - ....
I would like to turn it on to 50% brightness and turn it off without cycling to 100%.

This project is based around an [CC2500 2.4Ghz wireless controller](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/swrs040c/swrs040c.pdf) and an Atmega328 (ex Arduino Nano).

The choice for the CC2500 was easy because the original Anluta Remote uses this IC, so it's definately possible to use this for controlling the lamp.

Some code is loosely based on:

##Reverse Engineering

###Sniffing SPI
I had a look inside an orginal Ansluta remote, it uses an texas instrument uC ([MSP430G2221](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/msp430g2131.pdf)) and an CC2500.
The CC2500 communicates over an SPI bus to the uC. So I've connected a ["Bus Pirate"](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_v4_design_overview) to the SPI bus of the uC and sniffed the commands and data packets to the wireless chip.
 
![alt text](https://github.com/NDBCK/Ansluta-Remote-Controller/blob/master/RemoteSnif.jpg "Sniffing SPI data")


The settings for the bus pirate were ([SPI sniffer utility](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_binary_SPI_sniffer_utility)):
Clock Edge= 0, Polarity= 1 RawData= 0 

The sniffed data is in the file: ["SPI_DATA.txt"](https://github.com/NDBCK/Ansluta-Remote-Controller/blob/master/SPI_DATA.txt)

###Decoding SPI

####Button press
Every time the button is pressed a sequence is repeated 50 times: 2 data strobes are sent followed by a burst of data followed by a final strobe.

Together with the datasheet from we can decode the data:

```
//Strobe 1:
5B 5B 5C 5C 36 36 0F 0F 5D 5D 	//0x36 SIDLE Exit RX/TX, turn off frequency synthesizer and exit Wake-On-Radio mode if applicable

//Strobe 2:
5B 5B 5C 5C 3B 3B 0F 0F 5D 5D 	//0x3B SFTX Flush the TX FIFO buffer. Only issue SFTX in IDLE or TXFIFO_UNDERFLOW states.

//Burst of data:
5B 5B 5C 5C 7F 7F 0F 0F 5C 5C 	//0x7F Burst access to TX FIFO
06 06 0F 0F 5C 5C 
55 55 0F 0F 5C 5C 
01 01 0F 0F 5C 5C 
3E 3E 0F 0F 5C 5C
94 94 0F 0F 5C 5C
02 02 0F 0F 5C 5C               //Indicates the light intensity 01=OFF; 02=50%; 03=100%
AA AA 0F 0F 5C 5C 
FF FF 0F 0F 5D 5D 

//Final strobe:
5B 5B 5C 5C 35 35 0F 0F 5D 5D 	//0x35 STX In IDLE state: Enable TX. 
```
So the module is awakened from sleep mode, the send buffer is cleared, data is loaded into the buffer and finaly the data is transmitted. This is repeated 50 times presumable to ensure that the data is received at least one time.

Clearly some data is missing (configuration of the CC2500).


####Initializing Data
When the battery's are inserted in the remote some initializing data is sent to the CC2500 (without pressing a button).
Indicating that the module is powered on continuously and a power-down method is used for preserving the battery's.

###Prototype Hardware

The CC2500 is readily available as module on ebay with integrated antenna and capacitors so no RF design is needed. Only an SPI connection and power supply is needed. I chose a cheap ebay module with a real CC2500 IC (no glob top).

![alt text](https://github.com/NDBCK/Ansluta-Remote-Controller/blob/master/cc2500module.jpg "CC2500 module")

To communicate with the wireless module by SPI, I used an arduino nano because I had it laying around.
For connecting the nano to the CC2500 we have to be carefull with the different voltages. The CC2500 is 3V and the nano is 5V.
An easy (dirty) way to connect them is using a resistor (about 1K) in series with the data lines comming for the arduino (MOSI, CLK, CS). The data line comming from the CC2500 (MISO) doesn't need a resistor (a high level from CC2500 is 3V and the nano's input detects it as a high level without modifications).
The lineair voltage regulator (3.3V) on the nano is used as power source for the wireless module.

![alt text](https://github.com/NDBCK/Ansluta-Remote-Controller/blob/master/ProtoSch.jpg "Schematic of the prototype")

###Prototype Code
Now we have the necessary SPI data we and hardware we can write some basic code for the nano.
The resulting code can be found [HERE](https://github.com/NDBCK/Ansluta-Remote-Controller/blob/master/AnslutaProto/AnslutaProto.ino).
The configuration of the module is mostly the same as the original IKEA remote except the output power is changed to the maximal TX power by setting the first byte of the PATABLE with 0xFF.
The IDLE mode isn't used because after we configure the module we immediately send the data.

The SPI settings (found by looking at the graph in the datasheet "Configuration Register Write and Read Operations") are:
  * SPI Mode 0
  * MSB First
  * Max speed: 6Mhz (no need to use extra delays)

The prototype code simply sends the necessary signals to turn the lights on and off in an endless loop (for testing purposes).
Now that the prototype works it's time to make a couple of remotes to control the light.
 
It's needed to remark that the givven code uses the address that my original Ikea remote has. Somewhere within the 8 bytes that are sent in a burst will be an unique identifier. Without another remote to compare it to I don't know what the identifier is. (Probably there will also be a sort of error detection like CRC).
